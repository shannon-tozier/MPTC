predicate function: function that returns TRUE or FALSE

can use functions within "select()" such as "where(predicate function)" and "starts_with(character string)" and "matches(regular expression)"

can create custom operators like `%nin%` <- Negate(`%in%`) 

use "across()" to apply a function to multiple columns (kind of like a for loop) [look in week 5 slides for examples]

anonymous function: "\(x)"

sometimes functions start with "." just to avoid confusion with other objects

slides also show how to make cumulative calculations: cumsum()

lead() and lag(): allow access to previous and next vector values

you can write functions using the "function()" function

```{r}
my_fun <- function(x) {
  x + 1
}

my_fun(2)
```

give functions verb names that say what they do
